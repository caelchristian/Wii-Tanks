# CS 205 Final Project Team 10: Tank Game!
Created by Cael Christian, Levi Putman and Olivia Wilson.

## Overview
This is a Python implementation of the Wii Play Tanks game, made using the Python arcade library

## Getting started
1) Clone the repository from the GitLab
2) Make sure that you have the Python packages `arcade` and `numpy` installed
3) Run the command `python main.py` from the main directory
4) The game window should appear, have fun!

## Playing the game
- You can move your blue player tank with the WASD keys (W=up, S=down, A=left, D=right)
- You can shoot bullets by clicking the mouse
- You can aim by moving the mouse (the crosshairs will follow your mouse)
- You can plant a mine using the Space bar
- Try and beat all the levels by destroying the enemy tanks!

## Some rules to take note of
- Exploding anything (obstacles, enemy tanks, bullets, player tanks) will explode everything within the same vicinity.
- You will have to wait a few seconds before you can shoot bullets again and before you can place a mine again. No spamming!
- Bullets can only richochet twice before disappearing.
- The darker boxes can be blown up with mines, the lighter boxes can not.

## Assets/Sounds Source
We did not create the assets nor the sounds used in the game. They were sourced from the website https://kenney-assets.itch.io/top-down-tanks-redux
